        "description": "Dilute calico coloring is blue/gray and tan patches on a white/cream fur background, rather than the standard calico of black and red patches on a white fur background. Dilute calico is not extremely rare, but it is harder to come by, and kittens in this color range often fetch a higher price.",
        "ashtangayoga": "Many cat lovers believe there's no such thing as a calico male cat and that it is genetically impossible. Calico is not actually a breed but just a description of the color more than anything. Calico cats are tricolored in white, black and red (usually looks orange), although they sometimes come in dilute. In a calico, the colors never blend together but are in separate patches. It is a common misconception that only female cats can have calico coloring because it is quite rare for a male cat to have this coloring due to genetics:",
        "bikramyoga" : "Females have the chromosomes XX and males have the chromosomes XY. The colors for calico are tied into that second X (female) chromosome. The only way a male cat can be calico is to have an extra chromosome. This is called Klinefelter's Syndrome in humans. The cat would have XXY chromosomes and would develop as a male. The male cat will typically be sterile with this defect, but again, there are a few exceptions to even that rule.",
        "hathayoga": "However, if you believe you have a male calico unless your kitty has orange coloring on him, he is likely a Tortoiseshell, which is healthier for him."
